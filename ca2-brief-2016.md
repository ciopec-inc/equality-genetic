++ Computational Intelligence - Assignment 2

++++ Introduction

Download the code from the following GitHub repository.

https://github.com/stephensheridan/equality-genetic

The GitHub repository consists of five files.

Genetic.java :- This is the main driver file for the genetic algorithm

GeneticParameterTrial.java :- This file is similar to Genetic.java but automates the testing of some trial genetic parameters such as population_size, crossover_rate and mutation_rate.

Population.java :- This file implements a population of value encoded chromosomes. All the operations associated with the population of candidate soluitons are implemented here.

ValueEncodedChromosome.java :- This class represents a single value encoded chromosome.

README.md :- This file contains all of the info contained in this document in markdown form.

Part (1)

The first phase of this continuous assessment will be to finished off the implementation of the genetic algorithm.
value encoded chromosome class. All of the data members and methods have descriptions and stubs so all you have to do is complete their implementation. NOTE: Don't create new methods or change the calling signature of the existing methods.
